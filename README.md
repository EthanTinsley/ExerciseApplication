# ExerciseApplication
This is our final project for CSCI 3660 - Mobile Application Development 
The goal of the app is to create a user friendly app to create, view and utilize custom workouts.
THe user should be able to view a selection of exercises from our database. Each exercise donning a title,
description, image (to display proper form) and muscle group that the exerise works on. 
Additionally the user should be able to create a workout template, that is filled with all the exercises that 
they would like to do, and the sequence they would like to preform them. Once the user has created a workout template
They can start a workout which will allow them to view the current workout, switch between exercises within the workout, all while keeping 
track of how long the workout lasts and the date and time with which the workout was started. After the user finsihes a workout the results 
(date and time + duration) of the workout can be viewed in the completed workout section of the app.
